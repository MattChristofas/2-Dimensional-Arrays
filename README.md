# 2-Dimensional-Arrays
Functions that can be used to fill and create a two-dimensional array and process the data within.

The program begins by prompting the user to enter integer values for both rows and columns. The user is then prompted for the integer values that will fill the two-dimensional array. Afterward, the program prints out the max element, the sum of each row, and the sum for each column. The program will also tell you if the array is square (2x2, 3x3) and finally print a visual representation of the array you created.
